# Musicfetch
### Description
- Supported Song metadata:
    - Title
    - Album Title
    - Artist
    - Year released
    - Genre
    - Track Number
    - Total Tracks

This crate uses many experimental features because I like living on the edge and thus can only compiled with the nightly toolchain.

## Notes
- ID3v1 tags will be automatically upgraded to ID3v2

## Usage

In the UI for tagging you can use '+' or '-' to increment or decrement the track number of the current song. You can also use number keys 1-9 to set it directly.

## Dependencies
- yt-dlp
